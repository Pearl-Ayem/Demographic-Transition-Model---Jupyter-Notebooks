# Demographic-Transition-Model---Jupyter-Notebooks

For my project I decided to create a Demographic Transition Model (DTM) from human geography. The focus of a DTM is to show development level in a country based on the following population indicators:

1. Crude Birth Rate 
2. Crude Death Rate
3. Total Population

The original model theorized that countries pass through 4 stages of development, however more recent versions of the model use 5 stages-  something I decided to test in my project. 

It was particularly interesting to me because just from looking at the DTM one can find areas of “natural increase” (increasing population), “natural decrease”(decreasing population), population projections based on the death and birth rates, effects of pro-natalist or anti-natalist policy changes in a country and the population momentum (as seen for China), impacts of war (Baby Boom of the 1960s in Canada), dependency ratios (Germany) etc.
