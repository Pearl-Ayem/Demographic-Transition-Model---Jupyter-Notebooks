    "For my project I decided to create a Demographic Transition Model (DTM) from human geography. The focus of a DTM is to show development level in a country based on the following population indicators:\n",

    "1. Crude Birth Rate \n",
    "2. Crude Death Rate\n",
    "3. Total Population\n",
    "\n",
    "The original model theorized that countries pass through 4 stages of development, however more recent versions of the model use 5 stages-  something I decided to test in my project. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was particularly interesting to me because just from looking at the DTM one can find areas of “natural increase” (increasing population), “natural decrease”(decreasing population), population projections based on the death and birth rates, effects of pro-natalist or anti-natalist policy changes in a country and the population momentum (as seen for China), impacts of war (Baby Boom of the 1960s in Canada), dependency ratios (Germany) etc.\n",

    "Overall I was very content with the final result of my chart mostly because of how versatile the code could be. If I decided to add values to my file over the years or pick a different country it would generate a DTM very easily.

    "If we look at Germany - which indeed is a Stage 5 country as shown by the DTM - we can see that shortly after the 2000s, Germany's birth rate has been on a decline; the red line above the green line indicating natural decrease and the total population curve just started dipping down after 2014. So taking this a step further a population projection pyramid could be genrated or a dependency ratio analysis could be graphed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Canada the birth rate curve (green line) literally sees a bump between 1945 and 1969 - The post world war baby boom. With a very stable death rate and declining birth rate- Canada's total population is still increasing rapidly; an anomaly that can be explained by immigration. So an extra helper could be written that removes the effects of immigration to see if countries like Canada still follow the DTM or not, or if the DTM is an outdated way to judge to development in a country.\n",
    "\n",
    "In China's DTM the effects of the one child policy are very pronounced on the birth rates, however the total population does not decline rapidly- this anomaly attributed to something known as population momentum. Just like momentum in physics, population momentum basically tells you a growing population will not react immediately to a negative check such as a anti-natalist policies immediately; but like in China's case it did help China dodge its tipping point in population. However, a chart can be created to analyze if a country would cross its carrying capacity and eventually hit the tipping point or not, and in the case it did, a positive check such as famine or drought would create an immediate effect in the total population.\n",

    "A lot of human geography involves being able to construct models and make predictions based on current data and examples from the past, and a lot of the indicators of geography are interconnected. Like any subject a deeper analysis on the topic reveals that a lot more can be done in this field using systematic design- the above listed ideas being merely extracted from the DTM which is one single model of geography. In general I think systematic design is a pretty powerful tool in this subject area and makes data analysis very efficient.\n"
